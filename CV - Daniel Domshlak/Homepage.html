        <ul id="fullStoryParagraph">
          <li>At the age of 12-15 I was a high school student in<br>
          his early years, I loved music and I played hockey on <br>my school field after school.<br><br>
          </li>
          <li>
          At the age of 16-17 I was a high school student in his later years,<br>
          I loved music and played in a rock band alongside studying for matriculation.<br>
          We performed a few times and it was really fun, but there was a load of learning because I did 5 units of math and English.<br>
          In addition, I began to think about military service and gradually prepare for enlistment in the IDF.<br><br>
          </li>
          <li>
          At the age of 18-21 I was a combat soldier in the Artillery Corps. <br>
          I served in the Keren Regiment, underwent advanced training and coaching.<br>
          I then took a course in meteorology commanders in the corps, under the locating battalion.<br>
          Thanks to meteorological technology we were able to predict and collect data on various weather parameters in the lower layers of the atmosphere,<br>
          in order to pinpoint the flight of shells and rockets in order to effectively hit the enemy and prevent harm to our forces or innocent civilians.<br>
          I was the team commander in the Golan Heights and then the training and logistics commander of the unit in the Galilee. <br><br>
          </li>
          <li>
          At the age of 22-24 I was a patrol officer at the Dimona station. <br>
          I took a police course that lasted almost a year with experience, I handled various criminal and unusual incidents,<br>
          from the handling of an incident in the field, writing the reports and sometimes also a preliminary or ongoing investigation.<br>
          It was an amazing time, but I could not combine studies with full - time work with long shifts. <br>
          After 3 years in the police, when in the last year I was promoted to head of a shift in the sector that continues to the Arava Road, I decided to leave to study <br>
          for a bachelors degree and eventually chose a different field. <br><br>
          </li>
          <li>
          At the age of 25-26 I was after significant service in the army and the Israel Police,<br>I took a psychometric course at Yoel Geva and had the test.<br>After I was not completely satisfied with the score I went again and got 699, slightly
          more than the previous score (I really want to round that number every time I mentions it, but honesty wins).<br>Depending on the possibilities that opened up for me, I chose to study for a degree in information systems management at Ben
          Gurion University of the Negev.<br>I started studying and became a full-time student. <br><br>
          </li>
          <li>
          At the age of 27 I was a student of information systems management at Ben-Gurion,<br>
          in the second semester of the second year of study, and in the first semester of the third year of study.<br>I managed to be a partner in developing an app that might not enter the market properly, but it was a great experience and I learned a lot from it.<br>
          At the beginning of this period came the corona crisis so we moved on to learning from home.<br>
          Just before the crisis began, I started working as a student at DbMotion on the company's IT support team. <br><br>
          </li>
          That is it by now.
